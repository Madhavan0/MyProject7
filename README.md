# 🎮 Project 1 – Unreal Engine Bootcamp (Week 1)

This project was built as part of *Week 1* of [Jim Dublace's Game Development Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/@jimdublace). It focuses on core Unreal Engine concepts using *Blueprint scripting*.

## 🧠 What I Built

### 🔫 Water Gun System
- Fires water using input action (e.g., mouse or key press)
- Blueprint logic spawns a projectile or uses line trace

### 🛢 Water Refill Mechanic
- Player walks near a barrel (bareek)
- Refill action triggers when overlapping with the barrel

### ❤ Health Component
- Custom reusable Blueprint to manage health
- Supports taking damage and healing
- Applies to characters and interactive objects

### 🧰 Blueprint Learning Highlights
- Events vs Functions (when and why to use them)
- Overlap events (OnComponentBeginOverlap)
- Input system setup
- Organizing logic into clean, reusable functions
- Working with variables, references, and actors
